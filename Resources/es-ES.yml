WhatOurClientsSay: What our clients Say?
FranciscoSay: Our experience with Immigration Consulting was simply wonderful. Karina and her team supported with all of our needs. Customer service was excellent throughout the process, and I love their				human approach to tackling our issues. They did everything in their power to help, even including some aspects that were outside the scope of their day-to-day work. I felt involved, listened				to, and supported from start to finish. I would recommend them with my eyes closed. Clients can have absolute confidence in their efforts. Eternally grateful!
AmberSay: Thank you for your constant attention and guidance over the last four years to secure the next nine years of my investment visa. Without your support and services, none of this would be possible.		We are so grateful.
AnnaSay: Karina is the best lawyer I have ever met. She is a great professional and a warm-hearted human being! Together, we managed to solve the problem with an immigration fine I had. She was so patient,		replying to the million questions I had, always very friendly and supportive, making sure I fully understood all of the difficult things around my case. I really appreciate your help and wish you			all the best.
KleonikiSay: I have no words to express my gratitude to Immigration Consulting and especially to Karina Chuquimia, for having helped me to get my working visa and finally be legalized in Brazil! I am from			Greece, living in Rio for 5 years and all of this time I was struggling to get my papers done, but with no result. I have spent money and time with other lawyers that had no idea how to work				on immigration cases.. Karina is an excellent lawyer that knows everything about immigration and above all, she is a great human! She was always there to kindly answer all my questions,					explain the whole process and calm me down when I was worried! I highly recommend her to everyone that is still trying to be legalized! Gracias Karina! Eres la mejor.
PeterSay: There is no better immigration expert in Brazil! After 20 years here, I lost my permanent visa because of a divorce. For me, it was the end of the world. I spent 12 months trying to solve the			situation, without success. Then someone recommended Karina Chuquimia. I first contacted her at 5:30pm, by 10pm the same day; she was able to assure me that she would solve my problem. After 10			days, and a 2-hour meeting at the Federal Police, my problem was solved and I had my permanent visa (it is still difficult to believe). Besides being the best lawyer, she is also an incredible			human being. She is passionate about her work and really loves to help people. Her happy voice and big heart make you feel comfortable, even in a difficult situation. I strongly recommend because			you will not find better. Karina, you are my hero.
ScottSay: Wonderful service! I would highly recommend Karina and her colleagues to anyone with immigration issues in Brazil.
